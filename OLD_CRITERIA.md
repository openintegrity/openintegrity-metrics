# Criteria

The initial phase of the project led to the development of a broad set of criteria that impact end-user security and privacy.

The current phase of the project now aims to develop the metrics that can support the evaluation of such criteria and more broadly, support the esatablishment of ground truth about software that can be used to support evaluation of end-user security and privacy and other aspect regarding decision support around software.

The criteria below are referenced in the [ongoing development of the new open integrity metrics](/METRICS.md).
